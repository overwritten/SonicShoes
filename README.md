# SonicShoes
<i>"shoe make farmer go nyoom"</i>
### Description
Ever thought about how weird it was there were no speedy shoes in Stardew Valley? Well, now there is! Thanks to Krobus accidentally summoning items from the multiverse, we now have — you guessed it — Sonic the Hedgehog's shoes (or Sonic Shoes for short).

These shoes increase the farmer's movement speed when equipped. Now, you can go speedy fast! Buy them from Krobus and be on your merry way. The buff also stacks with your horse so you can go SONIC SPEED!

### Installation
1. Install the latest version of SMAPI.
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley\Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

### Uninstallation
Delete it from your mods folder.

### Tasklist
- [x] Complete the base of the mod
- [ ] Make buff customizable via config with GMCM
- [ ] Add an even bigger speed boost when you collect enough rings in the overworld, complete with SFX (thanks atra for the idea!)
